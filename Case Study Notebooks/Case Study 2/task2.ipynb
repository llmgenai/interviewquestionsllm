The glow worm was my first choice but had to return it because the music it too loud. For play during the day the volume is fine but our problem was - when my little guy fell a sleep with it and would roll over and/or bump it accidentally, the music would go off. Being that it was SO LOUD it would wake him & arouse him. He is the youngest of 3 boys so he is used to noise. We also keep an air purifier in his room that creates plenty of white noise and this was still a problem. This toy was suppose help sooth him back to sleep. Instead it would wake him up. I don\\'t know who the people are who make these toys (obviously not parents of young sleeping children) but you\\'d think common sense would tell you that if you make a \"Sleeping toy\" - it really needs a volume botton!! As all babies, people & situations are different. This toy also desperately needs a switch where you can turn off the music but still have it glow if you\\'d like - some babies/toddlers don\\'t need the music but would love the warm glow. I do think I should add that the glow worm is cute looking and firm (to help cut down on the risk of SIDS if your going to put it in your childs crib).
